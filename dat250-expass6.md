# DAT250 ASSIGNMENT 6 REPORT
This assignment introduced to me a message passsing system and publish/subscribe paradigm with use of rabitMQ. 
## Exercise 1 - Installation 
I succesfully set up rabbitMQ with use of Docker. I used command:
```
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4.0-management
```

Code for additional experiments is in directory [assignment_6](./assignment_6).

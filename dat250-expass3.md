The goal of this assignment was to implement a single page app to be able to use REST API through friendly user interface. 
## Implementation
For the simple single page app solution i used React javascript library with component library MaterialUI, that comes with prebuild components.
I made simple components as was mentioned in the assignment description: `CreateUserComponent`, `CreateUserComponent`and `VoteComponent` that serve to
handle basic request to create a user, create a poll and vote in the created poll.

## Conclusion
